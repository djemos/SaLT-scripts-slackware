I/ What “SaLT scripts”?
┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈
  → Slackware-live is a tool to create a live slackware iso.
  → SaLT scripts are a collection of scripts that deal with Slackware-live, can build live modules and that
    can create a ready-to-burn Live ISO.

  Both these tools are free (GPL v3+) and maintained by the same team:
    ▸ JRD <jrd@salixos.org>
    ▸ Shador <shador@salixos.org>
    ▸ Akuna <akuna@salixos.org>
    ▸ djemos <djemos@slackel.gr>

II/ Minimum requirements
┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈
  Some software must be installed in the host system. I will list them as named in Slackware/Slackel.
  Required:
   - spkg or pkgtools
   - coreutils, sed, grep, tar, gzip, bzip2, xz, findutils
   - glibc, sysfsutils, gcc, glib2, automake, autoconf, make
   - wget
   - fuse, util-linux-ng
   - squashfs-tools
   - perl
   - imagemagick
   - cdrtools
   - slackware-live
   - unionfs-fuse
  Optional:
   - xcf2png (if you provide a background image in XCF format)


III/ Create an ISO
┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈┈
  For creating an ISO, you only need few things actually.
  You will need a list of packages (organized by live modules),
  some custom packages (like an installer, …), the standard
  kernel packages (image, headers, …), a list of liveenv modules, and a PNG image for
  the bootloader background.

  1/ packages
  -----------
    You must now decide which packages you want to include in your ISO.
    You must also arganize your packages in collections (modules).
    Be carefull to put any package that depends directly on the kernel version in a separate
    module.
    The last module will contains a special package, named liveenv, which deals with configuring
    a live system.

    ◆ Create a file packages-foobar for each foobar module. This file will list each package on
      one line.
    ◆ Create a file MODULES_INFO with the referenced modules:
      ┊ module=kernel,packages-kernel
      ┊ module=base,packages-base
      ┊ module=live,packages-live

    You must now define which liveenv module you want to provide.
    You can list them in liveenv/modules directory. At least all 0? modules should be considered.

    ◆ Create a file MODULES.liveenv with the referenced liveenv modules:
      ┊ etc
      ┊ root-password
      ┊ hostname

    ◆ Copy your special packages in local directory:
      - sli (slackel-live-installer)
      - slackware-live

    Get all remaining packages by issueing:
      $ ./getpkgs.sh ARCH VERSION
    where ARCH could be 32 or 64 and VERSION is the Slackware version.

  3/ configuration
  ----------------
    You need to indicate some configuration before continuing.
    This is done in a file named “config”. Example:
      ┊ # vim: set syn=sh:
      ┊ if [ -z "$DISTRO" ]; then
      ┊ DISTRO=slackel
      ┊ VER=openbox-6.0
      ┊ #RLZ=test
      ┊ # empty for a final release for example
      ┊ RLZ=
      ┊ #
      ┊ #BGIMAGE_NAME=slackel.xcf
      ┊ # don't change this unless you sure that the newer version works the same
      ┊ FUFSVER=0.4.2
      ┊ FUFSURL=http://funionfs.apiou.org/file/funionfs-$FUFSVER.tar.gz
      ┊ # this is atuo-generated for convenience but you can provide another filename
      ┊ ISO_NAME=${DISTRO}live-$VER${RLZ:+-$RLZ}.iso
      ┊ # the package containing the live kernel. Normally you won't need to change this
      ┊ # unless you have a very good reason, use xz
      ┊ COMP=xz # could be xz, lzm, lzo, gz.
      ┊
      ┊ export DISTRO
      ┊ export VER
      ┊ export RLZ
      ┊ export BGIMAGE_NAME
      ┊ export FUFSVER
      ┊ export FUFSURL
      ┊ export ISO_NAME
      ┊ export COMP
      ┊ 

    You will also need a background image for the bootloader (the one you specified in the
    config file).
    The image could be in any format, but will be converted to PNG 640×480, 8bits RGB Color.
    If you decide to have a Gimp XCF source file, you will also need the xcf2png tool installed.

  
  ◆ After that, you just need to run:
      # ./build-iso.sh
